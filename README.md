Simple Banking System

Overview:

During this project, I was able to make a simple banking system by utilizing SQlite, the Luhn's Alhorithm, an assortment of classes, and the integration of SQlite with my IDE.

Introduction to SQL databases:
This project was my first introduction to using a SQL database. In order to understand how to use SQlite, I had to understand the basic syntax and dive more into how to use the command line. Within the project, one is able to make a new databases and tables in order to store a bank user's info. This info includes the person's credit card number, account balance, as well as a card pin. The card pin was generated using the Random class, and the credit card number was created using Luhn's Algorithm. 

Through a user interface, a person is able to choose whether they would like to create a new account, log into an account, or transfer cash between accounts. 

What can I do to improve this project?

One of the best ways I may be able to improve this project is to possibly add a person object in order to append a person to an account. I would also like to use Postgres instead of SQLite since I have become more familiar with Postgres since the beginning of this project. While using postgres, I would be able to combine both a person database with the banking database by using foreign keys. I also hope to cut down on repeated code in order to make my program more readable.
